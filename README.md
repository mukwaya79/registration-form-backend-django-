# registration-form-backend-django-
django
i didnt add the .gitignore file cause i had some problems with pushing the repo .

using a custom html, i didnt use modal form or formclass just for simplicity purposes.
 
 This is a simple application which takes in user data and then saves it to the database 
 
 in particular I used the Sqlite database and a custom HTML form built and
 
 designed with CSS and validated with JavaScript on the frontend and served with python framework-django on the backend.
